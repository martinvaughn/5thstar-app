# Home-Office-Post-Full-Stack-Application
After seeing many people losing their jobs because of the pandemic, I have decided to work on this application to help people who were looking for remote opening positions.

Home Office Post is a web application that allows the user to create an account and have access to real remote jobs pulled from a Rest API.

This application was developed from scratch using the following stack: NodeJs, MongoDB, JavaScript, Jquery, Ajax, HTML, CSS, Boostrap, and some other external libraries and packages.

It follows the MVC pattern and includes router protection, user authentication, password encryption, form validation, error handling, protection against CSRF attacks.
